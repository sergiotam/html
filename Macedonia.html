    A landlocked country, the Republic of Macedonia has borders with Kosovo[a] to the northwest,
     Serbia to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, and Albania to the west.[20]
    It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia,
    which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern
    Bulgaria and southeastern Albania. The country's geography is defined primarily by mountains, valleys, and rivers.
    The capital and largest city, Skopje, is home to roughly a quarter of the nation's 2.06 million inhabitants.
    The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians, a South Slavic people.
    Albanians form a significant minority at around 25 percent, followed by Turks, Romani, Serbs, Bosniaks, Aromanians
    and others.
